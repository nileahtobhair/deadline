Deadline
-----

Deadline is an application built as a fun tool for a quick injection of motivation.

This application is available to view <a target="_blank" href="http:niamhlawlor.com/deadline">here.</a>

The idea is to direct users to the landing page that contains a single simple instruction, without revealing the premise of the application.

The application will then estimate  (based on previous records , not possible circumstance or life expectancy based on region) the first year that the user will not be alive based on the year of birth entered by the user.
